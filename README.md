### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ash

I have been an Application Support Engineer for the last 8 years and am currently studying development in my spare time. In 2022 I moved to a different company and in my current role have been able to utilise the skills I have been learning over the last few years.  

Skills: SQL / HTML / CSS / Javascript / Python / Java / Git / Unix / Linux

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently focused on learning all I can about Java as this is the most widely used language in my current company. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data structures and algorithms
